This error suggests there's an issue with the package installation. Let's fix this in a few steps:

1. First, make sure you're using the correct version of next-auth that's compatible with your Next.js version. For Next.js 13+, you should use next-auth v4. Try installing with an explicit version:

```bash
yarn add next-auth@4.24.7
```

2. If that doesn't work, it might be a network connectivity issue. You can try:
   - Clearing your yarn cache:
   ```bash
   yarn cache clean
   ```
   - Then retry the installation:
   ```bash
   yarn add next-auth@4.24.7
   ```

3. Also, I notice in your code that you're using `GoogleProvider` but haven't imported it. You'll need to add the import:

```typescript:src/app/api/vs-api/auth/authOptions.ts
import GoogleProvider from "next-auth/providers/google"
// ... existing imports ...
```

If you're still having issues, you could try:
1. Using a different npm registry
2. Checking your network connection
3. Making sure you have the latest version of yarn installed
4. If all else fails, you could try using npm instead:
```bash
npm install next-auth@4.24.7
```

_**Assistant**_

This error indicates a network timeout issue when trying to connect to the package registry. Here are a few solutions you can try:

1. First, try setting a different npm registry using yarn:

```bash
yarn config set npmRegistryServer https://registry.npmjs.org
```

2. If that doesn't work, try setting a longer network timeout:

```bash
yarn config set networkTimeout 100000
```

3. You could also try using a different DNS. Add this to your `.yarnrc.yml` file:
```yaml
networkSettings:
  enableNetwork: true
  httpTimeout: 100000
  httpRetry: 3
```

4. If you're behind a proxy or VPN, try disabling it temporarily.

5. As a last resort, you can try installing using npm instead:

```bash
npm install next-auth@4.24.11
```

The issue seems to be related to network connectivity to the npm registry. If none of the above solutions work, you might want to:
- Check your internet connection
- Try using a different network
- Check if you can ping registry.npmjs.org:
```bash
ping registry.npmjs.org
```

Let me know which solution works for you!
