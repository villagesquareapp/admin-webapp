## Fixing TypeScript Type Error in React (12/12/2024, 16:14:28)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Type 'string | number | bigint | boolean | ReactPortal | ReactElement<any, string | JSXElementConstructor<any>> | Iterable<ReactNode> | Promise<...> | null | undefined' is not assignable to type 'ReactI18NextChildren | Iterable<ReactI18NextChildren>'.
  Type 'bigint' is not assignable to type 'ReactI18NextChildren | Iterable<ReactI18NextChildren>'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because the `attach.title` type is too broad. We need to ensure it's a string. Here's the fix:

```typescript:src/app/components/apps/email/EmailContent.tsx
// ... existing code ...
                      {selectedEmail.attchments.map((attach: { 
                        id: React.Key | null | undefined; 
                        image: string | StaticImport; 
                        title: string;  // Changed this type to just string
                        fileSize: string; // Changed this type to just string
                      }) => (
// ... existing code ...
```

I've simplified the type definition for `title` and `fileSize` to be just `string` instead of the union type. This should resolve the type error while maintaining functionality.
