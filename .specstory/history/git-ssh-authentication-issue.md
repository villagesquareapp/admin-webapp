## Git SSH Authentication Issue (12/12/2024, 16:41:02)

_**User**_

I did like to use already existing ssh key I have on my computer:

paulliano@Thanos:~/Desktop/my-codes/Village-Square/village-square-admin-dashboard$ git push -u origin main
remote: Invalid username or password.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/Tosinkoa/village-square-admin-dashboard/'

It seems like you're having an issue with Git authentication. The error suggests you're trying to use HTTPS authentication while wanting to use SSH. Here's how to fix this:

1. First, check your remote URL and change it from HTTPS to SSH:

```bash
# Check current remote
git remote -v

# If it shows https://, remove the current remote and add the SSH version
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:Tosinkoa/village-square-admin-dashboard.git
```

2. Make sure your SSH key is added to your SSH agent:
```bash
# Start the SSH agent if not running
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add your SSH key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/your_private_key_file
```

3. Verify your SSH key is added to your GitHub account:
- Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys
- Check if your SSH public key is listed there
- If not, add it by copying your public key content:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/your_private_key_file.pub
```

4. Test your SSH connection:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

5. Then try pushing again:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

If you need to find your existing SSH keys, they're usually located in `~/.ssh/`. Common key filenames are:
- id_rsa
- id_ed25519
- github_rsa

Let me know if you need help with any of these steps!

This error occurs because your SSH key file has incorrect permissions that are too permissive. The `.pub` file is actually your public key - you should be adding the private key (without the .pub extension).

Here's how to fix the permissions and add the correct key:

1. First, let's fix the permissions for both your private and public keys:
```bash
# Fix private key permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Fix public key permissions
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

2. Now add your private key (note: no .pub extension):
```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

The permissions should be:
- Private key (`id_rsa`): 600 (read/write for owner only)
- Public key (`id_rsa.pub`): 644 (read/write for owner, read for others)

After fixing the permissions, try pushing to GitHub again:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Let me know if you still encounter any issues!
