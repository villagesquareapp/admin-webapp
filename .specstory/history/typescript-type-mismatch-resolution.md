## TypeScript Type Mismatch Resolution (18/12/2024, 09:47:24)

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Type 'IEchosResponse | null' is not assignable to type 'ILivestreamResponse | null'.
  Type 'IEchosResponse' is not assignable to type 'IPaginatedResponse<ILivestreams[]>'.
    Type 'IEchos[]' is not assignable to type 'ILivestreams[]'.
      Type 'IEchos' is not assignable to type 'ILivestreams'.
        The types of 'host.address' are incompatible between these types.
          Type 'string | null' is not assignable to type 'string'.
            Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'string'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

The error suggests there's a type mismatch between `IEchos` and `ILivestreams`, specifically around the `host.address` property. The `IEchos` type allows `host.address` to be nullable (`string | null`) while `ILivestreams` expects it to be a non-nullable `string`.

Here's a concise fix:

```typescript:src/app/(DashboardLayout)/dashboards/echoes/page.tsx
// ... existing code ...
          <EchoeTable
            echoes={echoes?.data as ILivestreams[] || null}
            totalPages={echoes?.data?.last_page || 1}
            currentPage={page}
// ... existing code ...
```

This type assertion tells TypeScript to treat the echoes data as `ILivestreams[]`. However, you should ensure that the data structure actually matches what `EchoeTable` expects, or consider updating the `EchoeTable` component to handle nullable host addresses.
